# DNA_Sequencing

Just a quick coding project I did for a Biology student in Perl. I had to use Perl for this project which I had never used before. The development was driven by new requests over and over again. The naming convention is all over the place because I never cleaned up the code. Also the commenting is kept to a minimum and just serves for the student to remind her of what the code does.

Somebody with Perl expierence could definitly improve upon this programm but it was a quick and dirty coding as it had to be done fast.

All this programm does is it takes a DNA-Sequence as input and does some String manipulation to find different interessting properties that the student is interessted in. To be honest I'm not entirly sure what the program does from a biological standpoint I just transleted the user stories into code.

This project is closed and I'will probably never look back at it. I didn't like Perl because it does so many weird things and has some strange naming convetions.
